# Emotion Detection from English Text using BiLSTM and GloVe

Detect emotions (e.g., happiness, sadness, anger, etc.) from English text using a **Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM)** model and **GloVe word embeddings**.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project implements a deep learning model for emotion detection from English text. The model uses:
- **GloVe embeddings** for word representation
- **Bidirectional LSTM** for sequence learning
- A softmax layer for emotion classification

The model is trained to classify text into one of several emotion categories.

---

## ðŸ›  Features
- Pre-trained GloVe embeddings for robust word representation
- BiLSTM architecture for capturing contextual information
- Lightweight and efficient for real-time applications

---

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
The model is trained on the **dair emotion** dataset.

- **Emotion Classes:** [anger, fear, joy, love, sadness, and surprise]
- **Preprocessing:** Tokenization, padding, and embedding layer
